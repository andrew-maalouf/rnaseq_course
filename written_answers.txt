Question 3: How many novel “intergenic” (not overlapping annotated protein coding gene spans) genes have you identified?
Out of 20662 considered novels, 275 are intergenic, meaning 1.3300 %

Question 2: What percent of your novel transcripts are protein coding?
If coding potential threshold is 0.364, then:
Out of 275 intergenic novels, 261 are non coding, meaning 94.9000 %
and 14 are coding, meaning 5.0900 %
Out of 20662 considered novels, 7956 are coding, meaning 38.5000 %

Question 1: How good are the 5’ and 3’ annotations of your transcripts?
70.5300 % of my 5' annotations overlap
54.3100 % of my 3' annotations overlap
If considering novel transcripts only:
44.1500 % of my 5' annotations overlap
46.8900 % of my 3' annotations overlap
